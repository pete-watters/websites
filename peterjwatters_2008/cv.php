						I did not originally plan to continue studying so soon after my degree however luckily due to my high marks I was awarded
						a scholarship to do a masters free of charge and it was simply an opportunity I could not afford to miss. I decided to take the course
						part-time oveer 2 years to enable me to work at the same time and gain more experience while I study.

						<b>University Record:</b>
						<p>
						I recently completed my final year at Dublin City University. I
						studied a <a href="http://www.dcu.ie/prospective/deginfo.php?classname=DME" target="_blank">B. Eng in Digital Media Engineering</a>. The course covered a wide
						range of computer applications and computer science including
						software programming, informationretrieval, web design,
						telecommunications, signal processing, computer graphics,system
						administration and network security.
						</p>
						<ul>
						<li>Year Enrolled: 2003</li>
						<li>2nd Year grade:2.2</li>
						<li>3rd Year grade:2.1</li>
						<li>Final degree mark: 2.1</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Achievements:</b>
						<p>
						<p>
						In 2nd year I completed an individual project through Java 3D, to produce a modelof the universe. 
						I found this quite interesting and a field in which I would love to work. 
						It was a good achievement as everything was to scale including planet orbits,rotation and daylight time.
						</p>
						<p>
						In 3rd year I worked as part of a team to write a client server news production system using Java. 
						The client can view news articles and the server can edit these articles, upload pictures multimedia documents
						etc.						
						 My role focused on writing the client side application, testing and documenting our results. 
						I found this really enjoyable as it showed me how simple it is to produce a highly commercial application using a language like Java.
						</p>
						<p>
						My final year project was a dynamic web application and can be viewed <a href="http://www.peterjwatters.com/PEL/index.php" target="_blank">here</a>.
						It was an individual project tocreate an online library for a research lab at DCU. 
						It compromises of a MySQL database containing article details and a Wiki web space through which users can search for these documents. 
						I used MySQL, PHP, XHTML, XML and CSS extensively and I am really interested in this type of application.
