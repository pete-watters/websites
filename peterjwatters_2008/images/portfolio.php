						I am an Ocuco employee and was helping them to move the site to a new hosting location. The website was outsourced to a design company who did a great job with the design but delivered a poor quality site which wasn't 
						at all portable. I took over the project and made the site my own building on the existing CSS style. The site is now very high quality with an excellent navigation system and meets all of the web standards for XHTML, CSS and
						 accessibility. I wrote it using a mix of PHP for the core logic and JavaScript for the key features.

						<p>
						I designed this eCommerce site on a freelance basis for a company called SkanATM who supply equipment to taxi drivers. 
						It is a fully functional online store built using Joomla with a VirtueMart plugin.

						This was the main project I was working on during my time at <a href="http://www.jeebers.com">Jeebers</a>. 
						Jeebers focus on customisation of the standard <a href="http://www.jshop.co.uk/">jShop</a> online store engine. 
						I was working on reducing the checkout process from 4 steps into two which involved extensive modifications to be made. 
						We created a completely new checkout process and embedded it into the standard jShop package. 
						This was great experience for me as it involved extensive use of PHP and Javascript along with some Java to deal with credit card validation.
						This is the most high profile project I have worked on to date and am quite proud of the final result.

						This was another project I was working on during my time at <a href="http://www.jeebers.com">Jeebers</a>. I transferred the site form its old host to a 
						new host and domain and configured the site to work from its new location.

						I made this site for
							some friends of mine who are in a band. Its a simple static HTML
						information site currently acting to advertise the group and their music with a view to extending it to incorporate music downloads. 
						There is a full photo gallery I created using Coppermine photo gallery and a jukebox that streams their music.

						This site is an online library I made as my final year project for my B.Eng in Digital Media Engineering. 
						Its built with XHTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL and acts as an online database of academic papers produced by the PEL laboratory in DCU. 
						The site can be used to search for paper references globally and also features an administration section where references can be added, deleted or edited. 
						This was the first dynamic web-page I ever built and I got first class honours for it.
