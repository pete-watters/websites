							This is a project I worked on for Ocuco in 2009 for their pharmaceutical management software product. 
							It is still a work in progress as but is clean and crisp and a great advertisement of the product and it's key features. 
							I used PHP to build the application structure and <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a> and Javascript to provide 
							a more user friendly navigation system. 
							</p>
	                    	<p>
	                    	This project was completed on a tight deadline - 24 hours to be exact and the then Product Owner and I spent a full day working on it non stop.
	                    	He has since taken over control of the product from Ocuco and set up his own company TouchStore. They have rebranded the site to match but the framework remains much the same.

						I was an Ocuco employee between 2007 and 2009 in Customer Support. Due to my Web experience they asked me to help them to move their site to a 
						new hosting location. They wanted a redesign of the website and this was outsourced to a design company who did a great job with the design but 
						delivered a poor quality site. It was a completely static site which wasn't at all portable and a nightmare to maintain. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I took over the project and made the site my own building on the existing design and optimising it. 
                        I used PHP to convert it from a static HTML based site to an easily maintainable PHP application. 
                        I made the site high quality with an excellent navigation system and met all of the web standards for XHTML, CSS and accessibility. 
                        I wrote it using PHP for the core logic and JavaScript and flash for some additional features. 
						I used <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a> to build an easily navigatible menu.  
						</p>
						<p>
						Another aspect of this project was to improve SEO and use Google analytics to monitor users visiting the site and adding scripts to integrate the site with SalesForce. 
						After the re-vamp there was a period where a lot more leads were generated and it sparked interest in the company. They have since re-vamped the site again to match
						their new company colours.

						This was the main project I was working on during my time at <a href="http://www.jeebers.com">Jeebers</a>. 
						Jeebers focus on customisation of the standard <a href="http://www.jshop.co.uk/">jShop</a> online store engine. 
						I was working on reducing the checkout process from 4 steps into two which involved extensive modifications to be made. 
						We created a completely new checkout process and embedded it into the standard jShop package. 
						This was great experience for me as it involved extensive use of PHP and Javascript along with some Java to deal with credit card validation.
						This is the most high profile project I have worked on to date and am quite proud of the final result.

						This site is an online library I made as my final year project for my B.Eng in Digital Media Engineering. 
						Its built with XHTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL and acts as an online database of academic papers produced by the PEL laboratory in DCU. 
						The site can be used to search for paper references globally and also features an administration section where references can be added, deleted or edited. 
						This was the first dynamic web-page I ever built and I got first class honours for it.
