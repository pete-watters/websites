1 Project: WeatherMap App 
To help the public plan for the future you decide to build a Javascript weather forecast application. 
The application should allow users to build a list of cities (by default Dublin, London, Paris, Barcelona) 
and view a current weather forecast for all cities on the map. The application must be implemented as 
a Javascript application and run within a browser without any backend component. 


2 Minimal functionality 
- The user must be able to add a city to the list. 
- The user must be able to remove a city from the list. 
- All changes should be persistent – If the user adds or remove a city those changes should be 
stored and loaded back when application is run again inside the same browser 
- The user must be able to refresh the weather forecast 
- The application should present the forecasts on a map 


3 Deliverables 
Please supply the following

1. All Javscript, CSS, HTML files required to run the  application with index.html file inside root 
directory (All packaged as a zip)  

2. A short (1-2 pages) write up that explains you design choices 
• Why certain approaches were used, why others were not used 
• Why certain 3rd party libraries were used if any 
• Any design patterns you used 
• Anything extra you would have done given more time 
• Anything else you feel I should know 

4 Additional Information 

• The application can use any available free weather  API. However, since it has to run 
without a backend nor proxy, APIs that support JSONP protocol are recommended (see 
Resources) 
• The application can use any available free Map and geocoding API 
• The application will be tested with latest stable Chrome and Firefox browsers (you can use 
any Javascript/CSS/HTML features supported by both browsers) 
• You can use any 3rd party, open source, non-commercial Javascript libraries
