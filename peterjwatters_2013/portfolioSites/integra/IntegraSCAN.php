<b>IntegraSCAN</b> is a unique wireless barcode scanning solution that allows staff to check-in stock, check and amend stock levels, modify selling prices in real-time and create new products, all while staying on the shop floor.  The main difference with the traditional wireless terminal is that it works in real time, so you will never have to do tedious computer operations before or after using it: pick it up from the charger, and go!
</p>
<p>
The primary reason for Stock Levels and Cost Prices becoming out of date on any Epos system, is the time consuming nature of order validation.  IntegraSCAN allows you to ensure that all Front of Shop Sale items are marked at the correct selling price and that those selling prices are achieving maximum margin.  It also makes sure that all the items you received on each order have correct cost prices, and it provides an easy way for the front of shop staff to update your product database while they book in the stock.

<p>
Let’s take a real life example: your daily order has arrived, and a significant number of products you had ordered electronically have been replaced by new packaging with new barcodes and new prices.  Of course, those will not scan on the till.  Normally, you would have to ask a member of staff to sort this out, and s/he would spend considerable time and effort moving stock from the shop floor to store room and back to the till for scanning, correcting prices, and updating stock levels – with the net result that the order would probably not get validated, cost prices not updated, items left to scan at wrong prices with easily predictable effects on margins and turnover.
</p>
<p>
With IntegraSCAN, these steps can now be cut in half:  while scanning the stock, the items delivered are checked in, existing product file items are added to the order with the qty received, and their actual cost price is entered.  New products can be created on the fly as needed, therefore the entire Order is now on the system, with correct prices, descriptions and barcodes.  Maximum Margin for these items is now guaranteed!!

<h4> <font color="#046b95">Additional features of  “IntegraSCAN”:</font></h4>
<p>
The IntegraSCAN “Price Update” function allows you to, not only to confirm that the marked price is the same as that on the product file, but also – and more importantly – to confirm that those prices are achieving their Maximum margin through the “Retail Price Calculator” available in the Price Updates module.
The Integra Scan “Stock Check” function means you’ll never pay for a stock take again.  As ALL orders will now be validated, most Stock Levels will be correct all year round on the system, but it is good practice to check each shelf in your shop every 13 weeks.  This confirms that all processes are being followed by simply checking the Stock Adjustments report.  If there are no Stock Adjustments reported following a Stock check – then processes within your practice are being followed.  Your margins are being protected!!
</p>
<p>
The IntegraSCAN “Bulk Update” function gives you greater control and ease of control of your product file.  Move items you actually stock into new Stock Categories or User defined categories to run specific reports, track sales or track promotions. Assign items to new suppliers, guaranteeing lower purchasing costs.
