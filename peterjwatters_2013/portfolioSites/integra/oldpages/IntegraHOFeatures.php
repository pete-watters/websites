<h2>Integra HO features:</h2>

<p>Having aggregated data available for reporting at your Head Office will give true control pharmacy operations.  Ocuco have obtained invaluable experience with this type of integration in our partnership with Vision Express.
</p>
<p>
From a store’s perspective, mundane daily, weekly and monthly administrative tasks currently required to update head office of current events will be done away with, leaving staff more time for Patients and value added activities.
Combining this with powerful reporting capabilities, and with the ease of maintaining consolidated data for all stores connected to the system (“update-once” technology) can result in saving hundreds of man hours.
