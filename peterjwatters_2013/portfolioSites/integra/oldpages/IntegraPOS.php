<h3> Introduction </h3>
<a name="1.1"><a href="#top">Top</a></a>
<p>
Complementing Integra RX, but also a standalone till solution in its own right, IntegraPOS developed by Ocuco, is the first EPoS package fully integrated with the Dispensary and therefore aimed specifically at improving the workflow of Irish Pharmacies.
Based on the same three-tier open-architecture and highly reliable database as Integra RX, it is the most efficient and rapidly implemented EPoS system available to Irish Pharmacies today. 
</p>
<p>
Ocuco recognises the significance of technologically preparing your practice for better patient relationship management.  IntegraPOS follows the development of other Ocuco products for professional medical practices, with a wide user base in Ireland and the UK, and incorporates the feedback of its users.   At store level, the most basic requirements are to process financial transactions with the Customers accurately and efficiently, but IntegraPOS goes much further by integrating with the Dispensary and being able to show patients details and accounts, processing DPS payments, managing stock in the dispensary and at the front of shop, allowing to send orders and process deliveries, and much more.

<h4>Main Benefits of IntegraPOS </h4>
<p>
Increase your pharmacy’s productivity at the till by installing a very advanced EPoS with a very easy-to-climb learning curve.  The clean, uncluttered touch-screen shows you only the options you need for the current activity.  You can chose which members of staff will have access to the most sensitive functions.  Product file management is facilitated by using the price file issued by the IPU (updated monthly), or you can manage your own product file.  High quality reports can be produced effortlessly.  IntegraPOS supports Integra HO, making it the first Enterprise-class Windows based EPoS system for Pharmacy. But of course, the main benefit of IntegraPOS is the seamless integration with Integra RX.
</p>

<h4>Integration with Integra Rx</h4>
<p>
The basic feature is that you can produce prescription bags in Integra RX and scan them in IntegraPOS; however, there is much more to the integration between IntegraPOS and Integra RX.  The patients and products files are shared, allowing monitoring and maintenance of accurate DPS co-payments, charging to patient’s accounts, receiving payments for patients accounts, and even viewing patient’s details.  Ordering is also integrated, which enables the Store Manager to compose, send or check in an order without interrupting the dispensing, thereby improving the workflow in the Pharmacy.</p>

<h4>Stock Control and Ordering</h4>
<p>IntegraPOS shares the Stock module with Integra RX, the first system allowing Unit-Level Stock Control, designed to facilitate just-in-time stock management.  It can manage stocks and orders for both the Dispensary and the Front of Shop.  Stock Control and Price Control can be interfaced with a Handheld PocketPC, to gather data, book stock, and identify products for which you need new shelf-edge labels.  </p>
