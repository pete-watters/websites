<h2>MDS and MAR Management</h2>

<p>
<h3> MDS Cassette Sheet</h3>

<h4>Key feature</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only required by Practices supplying medication to Nursing Homes where those homes employ a Nomand, or similar, weekly Cassette system</li>
<li>Once configured, this report is automatically generated for every patient in the home requiring medication for the current cycle</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Benefit</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cheaper consumable costs. Integra Rx prints all forms to blank A4 paper, so no need to purchase expensive pre-printed fan-fold reams of paper</li>
<li>As Integra Rx does not require a dot matrix printer when printing reports, the print for Cassette sheets delivered to the Nursing Home is of a much higher quality.  This reduces confusing in the nursing home, thus reducing calls to the practice and increasing patient safety</li>
