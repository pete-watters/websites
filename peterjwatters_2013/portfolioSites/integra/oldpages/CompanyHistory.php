<h3>Brief history of Ocuco</h3>

<ul>
<li>	The Computer Department Ltd (est’d 1993) designed and developed the first Windows™ based practice management solution for opticians. TCDL was founded by Ocuco’s current CEO and majority shareholder, Leo MacCanna.</li>
<li>	Clinical Software Ltd (since 1992), offered a DOS based clinical patient recording systems for ophthalmologists </li>
<li>	These two companies merged in 1997 to form Ocuco Ltd</li>
<li>	Its product line for Opticians and Ophthalmologists, Acuitas, is widely acclaimed in Ireland and the UK, and it is implemented in both private practices and large hospitals.  Acuitas Enterprise was the first multi-practice patient relationship management solution of its kind and was first released in 1999</li>
<li>	In February 2000, Ocuco entered the Pharmacy market, having been chosen to develop a Pharmacy Dispensary application based on the success of the Acuitas suite of software and its acceptance in a similar environment. The software was developed on the requirements, the specifications and input of a group of Irish pharmacists. </li>
<li>	With its Prometheus product line, comprising a Dispensary PMR system, an EPoS system, and an Enterprise solution.  Prometheus was the only Windows / Oracle / Enterprise solution for the Pharmacy market available in Ireland – which remains to be the case today.</li>
<li>	In 2006, Ocuco decided to rewrite most of its Prometheus product line, to update its workflows, internal mechanisms and components, and make it a true 21st Century system.</li>
The Integra Pharmacy Management Suite was born.
