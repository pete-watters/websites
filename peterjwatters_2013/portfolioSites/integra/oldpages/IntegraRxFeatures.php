<h2>Features</h2>

Integra provides you with a large number of unique features:

<ul>
<li>	Automatic DPS co-payment tracking </li>
<li>	Unique Prescription Cash Management module</li>
<li>	Second Generation PCRS Claims (XML), allowing you to correct exceptions before the early payment deadline
</li>
<li>	No transaction fees on PCRS Claims</li>
<li>	Groundbreaking Monitored Dosage System for Nursing Homes and private patients.  </li>
<li>	Possibly the best example of sheer volume of time that could be saved with Integra Rx is the MDS module - We have benchmarked existing users of the QIC Script MDS module where hours are needed to re-key repeat Phased dispenses where the end of a phase has been reached.  This time lot and errors that occur would all be removed as repeating all patients in a 70 bed Nursing Home and printing their Cassette sheets (Nomad) or labels, takes 20 minutes.</li>
<li>	Unique Methadone Dosage module </li>
<li>	SMS text messaging sends Prescription Reminder and Prescription Collection messages directly to patient mobile phones and recoups the cost of this service from the patient</li>
<li>	Unique “Script Due” patient search filter, allows you to select patients due for repeat  prescriptions today allowing you to prepare regular patients scripts.  The Automatic Collection SMS message will then be sent to prompt patients to present for their prescription </li>
<li>	Multi-Store System, proven to be scalable from 1 to over 200 sites</li>
<li>	Centralised selected store functions</li>
<li>	Global visibility of multiple stores</li>
<li>	Unique data mining and business analysis technology: adds real value through the representation of the facts about the pharmacy, staff and patients.  Integra materialises the value of the information gathered in the pharmacy by allowing it to be easily and quickly analysed. Most software packages offer some form of reporting capabilities, but Integra proposes a unique analytics offering, providing new and innovative clinical and retail analysis.</li>
