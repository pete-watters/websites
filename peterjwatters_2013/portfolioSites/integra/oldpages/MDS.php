<h2> MDS (Monitored Dosage System):</h2>

<p>
The Monitored Dosage System allows the preparation of prescriptions for Nursing Homes and private patients.
 <br />
MDS is possibly the best example of huge time savings with Integra Rx.  We have conducted benchmark tests with existing users of competing systems, where hours are needed to re-key repeat Phased dispenses where the end of a phase has been reached.

<br />

With Integra, operating time and risks of errors are dramatically reduced: repeating all patients in a 70 bed Nursing Home and printing their Cassette sheets (Nomad) or labels, takes approximately 20 minutes.
