  <h2>Issue Reporting Procedure</h2>

  When encountering a new issue with the product or service, the customer&rsquo;s authorised representative shall immediately contact Ocuco&rsquo;s support services by telephone, fax or email &ndash; providing a full description of the issue and / or its symptoms.  At this time, Ocuco Engineers may need to ask further questions of the contact to properly diagnose and accurately record the relevant behaviour of the system.  It may then be appropriate for Ocuco to request a remote link to further diagnose or retrieve log files to aid in diagnosis. <br>
  Upon initial communication of a new issue, its detail will be entered into Ocuco&rsquo;s Helpdesk System &ndash; which will generate a unique Issue number.  If the issue cannot be resolved immediately, an issue number will normally be communicated to the user upon generation (by phone) or within 60 minutes (by email). <br>
  Ocuco will analyse and assign the Issue Category on generation of the Issue Number, and will respond accordingly.
  <br>
  On receipt, the customer is obliged to record and reference this issue number in any future correspondence within its life.<br>
  The Customer accepts that the availability of the appropriate customer representative to assist Ocuco Support Engineers throughout the issue life cycle is directly related to its resolution time.<br>

<h3>Customer Support mechanisms </h3>
  As stated above, Ocuco has developed a set of internal structures and procedures to manage the quality of the services provided by each and every department.<br>
  As a proof of that, Ocuco has been Highly Commended for three Customer Service Awards in 2007.<br>
  As an example of measurable success, the Support department measures a number of factors daily to reflect their performance and how it progresses. The quality of service delivered by the team is measured using statistics generated on a weekly basis from our call logging application. These statistics highlight:
  <ul>
  <li>The number of Customer Support issues logged with the department in a particular time frame e.g. per week<br>
  <li>Number of issues outstanding at any given time</li>
  <li>How many of the issues were resolved in the same day that they were logged</li>
  <li>Time taken to drive any particular issue to resolution</li>
  <li>Number of hours spent solving issues from one particular site, prompting targeted preventive action or re-training if required </li>
  <li>The longest outstanding issues in the company. These issues are then highlighted and prioritised and escalated.</li>
  <li>Particular application areas where many customers are experiencing issues. We then work with our Development department on improving these areas</li>
  </ul>
  Our quality of service is also measured by Management. A random cross section of closed issues are reviewed by our Operations manager to ensure that they were handled correctly and progressed with maximum efficiency. </p>
