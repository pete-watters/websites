<h3> <font color="#046b95">Integra SMS</font></h3>


<p>
Integra Rx is the first pharmacy dispensing software in Ireland to automatically send prescription Collection, prescription Reminder and new Script required messages directly to patients, while ensuring all costs are recouped from the patient with no extra steps to your normal workflow.

<b>Imagine the scenario: </b> <br />

Patient John Kendle is due to have his prescription filled in 5 days.  Integra RX automatically sends an SMS message to John informing him that his script will be due in 5 days.  He replies to the message, requesting that his prescription is filled.<br /><br />

A non- intrusive user message will appear at the bottom of your dispensary screen, to inform you that a Text message has been received. <br /><br />

No immediate action is required.  <br /><br />

At any time, staff can filter the ‘Patient Search’ to display patients who have sent Text messages, read the message and select the patients file.  The patient’s medication can be selected and repeated in the normal way.  Once completed, “Integra Rx” will send a message to the patient to inform them that their Prescription is ready for collection.  <br /><br />

Now all John has to do, is turn up.
</p>
<p>
Configuring “Integra Rx” to send and receive SMS messages to and from selected patients automatically is easy.  When a patients’ file is accessed, answer ‘Yes’ to the question: 
<ul>
<li> “Do you wish to configure this patient to receive SMS messages?”</li>
<li>Then enter the patients’ mobile number.</li>
<li> That’s it.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You can of course customise the text of your messages, the duration of the reminders (e.g. how many days before the prescription is due), the fees charged to the patients who subscribe to the services, and many other options.  But each of these options has a default value.
You can also adjust the date and time SMS reminders are sent to help load balance busy periods.  This greatly improves efficacy in the dispensary by evening out pecks and troughs allowing you to control when staff will be required more effectively.

<p>
The “New Rx Required” message will also improve efficiency, and turnover, by reducing the number of Loaned scripts, thus reducing processing time for re-keying loaned scripts and reducing the number of items dispensed and not claimed for.
</p>
<p>
Technically, the SMS messages are sent via “Integra Rx” to the Ocuco offices and forwarded through a secure, encrypted Web messaging provider who route the SMS messages to your patient’s mobile phone.  This way, the messages are all logged against the patients PMR, are fully traceable, and the system is much more efficient than using a mobile phone.
