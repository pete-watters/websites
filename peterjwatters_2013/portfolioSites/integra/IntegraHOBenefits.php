<p>
Having aggregated data available for reporting at your Head Office will give true control of pharmacy operations. Ocuco have obtained invaluable experience with this type of integration in our partnership with Vision Express in the Optical sector and a number of privately owed Irish Pharmacy groups.
</p>
<p> 
From a store’s perspective, mundane daily, weekly and monthly administrative tasks currently required to update head office of current events will be done away with, leaving staff and management more time for Patients and value added activities. Combining this with powerful reporting capabilities, and with the ease of maintaining consolidated data for all stores connected to the system (“update-once” technology) can result in saving hundreds of man hours.
