I am an active blogger as I find its a great way of recording history and sharing information. 
I have a few seperate blogs for various activities both to categorize them and to add some extra wordpress templates to my portfolio. 

A lot of clients I've helped with websites benefit from using a CMS and it was important for me to get to grips with various engines so I could answer their questions honestly and effectively and help them as much as I can.
